            <div class="welcome-message">
                <p>Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, To all the beloved of the Apostolic Dominion Holy Church of Jesus Christ—and to every visiting soul that has crossed the threshold of this Apostolic Holy Convention—I greet you in the most powerful, matchless, miracle-working name: JESUS! This is not just another meeting, not just another moment—this is a divine move, a supernatural summons. The heavens are open, the fire is falling, and the saints are rising because “His Name Is Jesus!” We have stepped into a God-appointed season, and as your Apostle, I must declare: “God arranged the change!” It wasn’t a breakdown, it was a breakthrough. It wasn’t rejection, it was redirection. Everything that shifted in your life—God orchestrated it to bring you here, right on time.
We’re not just attending a conference; we’re walking through a door. And this weekend, we’re coming with fire, hunger, and purpose! Friday Night, we rise in strength with Bishop Darryl Williams for Men and Women’s Night. Saturday Morning, we invest in the future on Youth Day with Pastor Anthony Frye. Saturday Night, we remember the foundation and fuel the vision at Founders Night with Apostle Charles Marsh. And Sunday at 12 Noon, we close in divine order and Holy Ghost power on Official Day.
But let me tell you something right now… “You got grace in every place.” Wherever life has planted you, grace was already waiting. In the storm, in the fire, in the dark, in the dry place—grace was there. You didn’t survive because you were strong—you survived because grace carried you! Some of you are wondering why the process was painful, why you’ve been torn open and bruised. But hear me: “The gift has to be ripped to get what’s inside.” The tear was necessary. The breaking was divine. God was unwrapping your calling. You thought it was destruction—but it was destiny being revealed.
“Another one bites the dust” may sound like defeat, but in this kingdom it’s a victory cry. Everything not like God? Let it die. Every chain, every cycle, every weight—bury it here at the altar. Some things had to fall so the real you could rise! And now I speak as your Apostle with urgency and clarity: Don’t look back. Don’t stand still. Don’t freeze in fear. Live forward! The church has too many people dwelling in memories instead of moving in mission. The glory cloud is not behind us—it’s ahead! The revival is not coming—it’s here!
But be careful… Don’t follow the noise—follow the sound. Noise is hype. Sound is heaven. Noise fades. Sound carries. Noise excites. Sound births movements. And the sound we hear now? It’s the sound of JESUS. The same Jesus that heals, saves, delivers, and reigns!
So, I charge you all: Walk worthy. Live holy. Pray harder. Praise louder. Worship deeper. And love each other without condition. Let’s kill the gossip, crucify the flesh, and provoke one another to good works. Because guess what? “God has prepared a table before you in the presence of your enemies.” And I say to you: Pull up a seat—and get ready to eat! What God has blessed, no man can curse. What God has opened, no devil can shut. What God has ordained, you don’t need man to validate.
This is the hour. This is the house. This is the move. One Lord. One Faith. One Baptism. And ONE Name under heaven whereby we must be saved—JESUS!
God bless you and welcome to the Apostolic Holy Convention!
Apostle Matthew Eady
Apostolic Dominion Holy Church of Jesus Christ
